      <title>AI-Based Deep Learning</title>

      <description>Genomic selection has been a hot spot in agricultural breeding. Compared with the traditional breeding strategy, it provides opportunities to improve genetic gains for many complex traits. Past research in genomic selection focused primarily on building statistical models that predict phenotypes by genotype data alone. It is well known that information flows from DNA to phenotype through multiple layers of regulatory networks and intermediate molecular phenotypes. Thus, we consider that artificial intelligence (AI) models, which can capture the architecture of information flow, would greatly improve the accuracy in terms of phenotype predictions.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Based Pork</title>

      <description>Meat safety assurance and traceability is a major challenge in the pork industry. For example, most current systems of product quality inspection rely on 3rd party supervision and still employ random inspection methods, with information poorly organized and vulnerable to manipulation. With features of distributed storage and immutability, the blockchain technology has broad application prospects in terms of building trust for the field of food traceability. Moreover, blockchain-based intelligent contracts allow for rapid real-time whole supply chain-level alarming and subsequent actions, whenever a food safety issue arises.</description>

      <description>As a simple and highly efficient genome editing tool, the CRISPR system has been quickly and widely adopted in the life sciences, basic medicine, and agricultural breeding. Our institute is committed to being a leader in the optimization and application of the CRISPR system in animals. We have developed the “C-CRISPR” technology, with which we can obtain, in the F0 generation, mice and monkeys with the complete knockout of single or multiple genes.</description>

      <description>Pigs are similar to humans in terms of body size, physiology, organ development, and disease etiology. Compared to horses, cattle and other large animals, pigs have a significant advantage in fecundity. Therefore, pigs hold the promise of functioning as a biologics factory to efficiently produce humanized antibodies. We are aiming at introducing human immunoglobulin genes to replace the pig counterparts in pig embryonic stem cells, thereby building an anti-infective drug production platform.</description>

      <description>Most pig economic traits are complex traits, which are under the regulation of complex interactions among multiple genes. Thus, understanding the genetic architecture of these traits would greatly benefit from approaches integrating multi-omics data, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. In our program, we are developing novel experimental methods and computational methods to integrate multi-omics data to elucidate the genetic basis of important economic traits in pigs. We are also continuously expanding our germplasm resources to profile genetic and phenotypic variation, at both the organism-trait level and the molecular-trait level.</description>

      <description>Following reading and decoding of the information in animal genomes, by using synthetic biology approaches to modify or even build a genome, it will fundamentally transform how we grow food, what we eat and where we source materials and medicines. Based on the concept of “synthetic breeding”, we are dedicated to building a pig synthetic biology platform, to collect and aggregate the DNA sequences causing superior phenotypes into in the same pig line, which was named “SuperPig”.</description>
